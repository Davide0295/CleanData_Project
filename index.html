        <h1>Plastic Waste in European countries</h1>
        <p>The aim of this analysis would be to provide a comparative study of plastic waste in European different countries,
        focusing on answering the following research questions: <br> 
        <br>
        <i>"What is the relationship between the plastic waste generated and that treated? Which countries in Europe are making the greatest progress
            in reducing their plastic waste and how is each country treating this waste?"
        </i>

            <h2> The gap between plastic waste generated and plastic waste treated keeps increasing in Europe </h2>
            <h3> In 2020 there is a 70% increase from the difference in 2010, European countries are not keeping the pace of their plastic waste generated.

            <div id="lineDesc"><p>Here we present the relationship and trend between plastic waste generated and plastic waste treated in Europe.
                A <b>line chart</b> shows how the amount (in tonnes) of plastic waste generated and plastic waste treated evolved across the years. Both variables have a positive trend,
            so we focus on the gap between the two (grey line). This clearly shows that the generation of plastic is growing gaster than what European countries are able to treat. </p></div>

        <h2> How many kilograms (kg) of plastic waste do you generate on average in one year? </h2>
        <h3> Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and Austria generate over 40 kg of plastic waste in a year. Montenegro, Türkiye and Serbia 
            lead the plastic environmental progress with less than 10 kg of plastic waste per capita. <div class="info">

        The aim of this visualisation is to be able to compare how much plastic waste is being generated by citizens in different countries, in particular
    which are generating more or less plastic waste compared to the European average. 
<br>
<br>
Some smaller countries that do not add much plastic waste to the absolute value generated,
have a large ratio per capita, which represents what a citizen generates on average. This is the
case of Luxembourg and Belgium.</p></div>

                for other European countries.

        <br>
        <br>
         Italy, Germany, the UK, France and Poland account for most part of the plastic waste generation in Europe in the past 10 years. According to the previous bar plot, Italy and the UK still represent some of
    the highest values per capita.
<br> <br>The percentage of plastic waste treated over generated varies greatly among European countries. The UK, Belgium, Greece, Ireland and Estonia are the least accountable countries for the plastic the produce.</p>

        <h3> Although treating the total amount of plastic waste generated should be a priority, management operations have 
            different impact on the environment. In particular, recovery (recycling, energy recovery and backfilling) is greener than disposal
            (incineration and disposal in landfills).  <div class="info">
