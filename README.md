### Aim
The aim of this analysis would be to provide a comparative study of the different plastic
disposal methodologies adopted in different countries of the EU across the years, to find how the
trend changed and how these relate to the global plastic generated in each country.

After considering different research questions, we finally decided to focus on answering the following: How is plastic treated in different countries of the EU, how is the trend evolving over the last years and what is the relationship between plastic waste treatment and plastic waste generation?

The data used for this project has been collected from Eurostat:
* [ Eurostat - Plastic management operations in EU countries, over the years](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/ENV_WASTRT__custom_3487128/default/table?lang=en)
* [ Eurostat - Plastic waste generation in EU countries, over the years](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/ENV_WASGEN/default/table?lang=en&category=env.env_was.env_wasgt)

This has been cleaned and pre-processed as documented in the CleanData_Assignment_2.
A first Data Analysis Report has been produced using Tableau, full details can be found in the CleanData-Assignment3.
